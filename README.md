> [!TIP]
> Since the 0.10.0 release you can also get a nice template via `zine init`

# Template Zine

A barebones [Zine](https://github.com/kristoff-it/zine) template, for Zine stable releases.

# Usage
- Click `Use this template` -> `Create new repository`
- Name and create your repository
- Clone it with git
- Run `zine` to startup a server
- Make your static site!

# Older templates
Because GitHub templates don't have any versioning scheme, older templates are available as branches
- Tick `Include all branches` box when creating your repository
- Switch the default branch to the version you want to use
- Remove all other branches
- Rename the branch to main/master
- Follow regular usage instructions
